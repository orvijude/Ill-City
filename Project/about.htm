            <h1>About Ill City</h1>
            <div class="abt-txt">
                    Ill City was established in 2014 with the aim to promote our
                    hometown, Iloilo City, through urban street fashion. Iloilo is
                    the city of love and we wanted to provide Ilonggos with a medium
                    for displaying their love for the city. Our designs showcase some
                    of the city's historic monuments that symbolize how significant 
                    our South Town is. Ill City Clothing is jam packed with mean, 
                    not just style.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We want to encourage our generation to be genuinely proud of you
                    hometown, your roots. Revive the old school patriotism through new school
                    urban street style. No matter where you are in the world, carry your culture
                    and your hometown with you.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Ill City isn't your ordinary retail fashion hub. we've got big dreams and 
                    Ill City Clothing is going places. Ultimately, we want to make every
                    city an Ill City. And ecentually maybe even world domination! But we'll
                    keep our dreams in check for now and focus on bringing you 
                    something to be proud about. Represent your Ill City, 
                    be united by the place you call home.
